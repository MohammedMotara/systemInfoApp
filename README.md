# systemInfoApp
This is an app that is for the purposes of training/ note taking on how to produce a basic electronjs app.


// One way of installing electron is to install it globally and then install/ save electron as a dependency within the source folder.
//That way you've got a record of the version of electron you're using.

// I attempted to just download electron and contain it to this folder, but npm was throwing up several errors. As a way to save time
// I installed it using the method above. As a later task I'll look into this error.
